Todos Example Application, Stor.IO style
========================================

This is a fork of the Todos example application that is part of the [Backbone.js Framework](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone/), modified to use [Stor.IO](http://stor.io) instead of *localStorage*.

Stor.IO is a JavaScript library that provides an appStorage object for HTML5 applications to store their data remotely - without the hassle of setting up your own server.  You can [read more about Stor.IO here](http://blog.sourcebender.com/easy-storage-for-html5-applications.html).
